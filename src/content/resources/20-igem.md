iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is an organization that aims to cultivate a vibrant community of synthetic biology researchers. They host an annual competition for high school and collegiate teams to conduct synthetic biology projects that address everyday issues facing the world. It's a unique opportunity for undergraduates to take charge of their own project and to collaborate with fellow students. My own experience on Yale's iGEM team helped me grow immensely as an independent researcher, from learning to troubleshoot experiments to dealing with failure.
