This book has helped me fill in some of the gaps between the seemingly-disparate studies of development, evolution, neuroscience, and AI. I've often wondered whether trying to combine all of these in my own research would be too daunting of a task; Dr. Hiesinger, a professor at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, effectively brings all of these topics together, allowing me to contextualize my questions in the history of the field and in current research.
