The Complex Systems Institute at the University of Vermont is home to an interdisciplinary collection of researchers studying a wide variety of problems in complex systems, from sociology to evolution. The Institute is close to my heart: having grown up in Vermont, I have heard many  presentations from members of the Institute at various events and workshops. and also worked with [Dr. Joshua Bongard](https://www.meclab.org/) during my senior year of high school. The institute's proximity as I was growing up has undoubtedly influenced my research interests today.
