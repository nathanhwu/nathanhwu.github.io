This book fills in the gaps between the seemingly disparate studies of development, evolution, neuroscience, and AI. I've often wondered whether trying to combine all of these in my own research would be too daunting of a task; Dr. Hiesinger, a professor at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, effectively brings all of these topics together. Reading this book has allowed me to contextualize my own questions in the history of the field and in current research.
