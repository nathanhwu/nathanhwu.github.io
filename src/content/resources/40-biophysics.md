Traditionally, "biophysics" has referred to molecular and cellular topics such as structural biology, crystallography, microscopy, and enzyme kinetics. However, today, the term applies more broadly to any application of physics to living systems, from [neural network theory](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/summary/) to self-assembling systems and active matter. Institutions sometimes separate these topics into different departments: often times, physics departments are home to topics in this broader definition while biology departments are home to the more traditional topics. Only a small number of institutions have biophysics programs that span all of these areas.
