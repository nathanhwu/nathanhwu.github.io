Conway's "Game of Life" is the most well-known example of "cellular automata", where a regular grid of cells each occupy a certain "state" (in this case, a"alive" or "dead") and transition between them according to a predetermined ruleset. In the Game of Life, a cell's state is governed by the states of itself and its eight neighbors. Despite the simplicity and deterministic nature of the [ruleset](https://playgameoflife.com/info), Conway's Game of Life can yield infinitely complex [patterns and machines](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon) (it is Turing complete). It's a far cry from what real "life" looks like, but highlights how incrdible complexity can emerge from simple building blocks.
