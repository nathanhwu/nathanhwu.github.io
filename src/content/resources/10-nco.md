Conway's Game of Life is just the simplest out of many automata models of growth and development. This paper/demo, built by a team at Google and Dr. Michael Levin, is a personal favorite: it mimics regenerative processes by applying cleverly defined, neural network-based update rules to reliably produce a pattern, even upon perturbation. Those who are further interested in cellular automata should also check out [Lenia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html), a cellular automata that is continuous rather than being discretized into individual cells.
