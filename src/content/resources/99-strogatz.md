I've been working through this introductory textbook in order to fill in some gaps in my knowledge in the field of dynamical systems. The approach offers an incredible amount of insight into a wide variety of natural and artifical systems, making it an appealing method to draw conclusions and find commonalities that span scales and systems. There is also a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V) containing recordings of Strogatz's own lectures from his "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" class at Cornell.
