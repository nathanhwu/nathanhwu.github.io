    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an incoming graduate student at <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard's PhD Program in Neuroscience</a>. 
        I'm broadly interested in exploring how complex biological systems organize to robustly support diverse computations.
        I hope to uncover general computational principles that span timescales and systems (both neural and non-neural). Some methods and tools I'm interested in exploring include graph theory, dynamical systems, and recurrent neural networks.
        I'm grateful to be supported by a <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/education/graduate-fellowship/" target="_blank">Kempner Graduate Fellowship</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Yale University in 2024, where I double-majored in Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry as well as Computer Science.
        While I was there, I studied neural computations in fruit fly motion detection with <a href="https://clarklab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Damon Clark</a>. 
        I also spent two summers as a visiting student researcher in <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/" target="_blank">Michael Levin's</a> lab at Tufts University where I studied the self-organization of neuronal cultures on a high-density microelectrode array system.

        <b>April 2025 </b> - I committed to Harvard's Program in Neuroscience for my PhD, where I'll be supported by a Kempner Graduate Fellowship (view the announcement <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/news/kempner-institute-announces-recipients-of-2025-graduate-fellowships/" target="_blank">here</a>). I'm incredibly excited to be part of such an exciting community of scholars, and I'm grateful that I'll be close to family and friends over the next few years :)

        <b>March 2025 </b> - My very first <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2410768122" target = "_blank">paper</a>, titled "Broken time-reversal symmetry in visual motion detection," was published in PNAS (featuring some photos of me hiking in Yosemite)! 
        Many thanks to my PI, Damon Clark, and my co-first author, Baohua Zhou, for their mentorship. Access the PDF <a href="/papers/clark-et-al-broken-time-reversal-symmetry-in-visual-motion-detection.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
