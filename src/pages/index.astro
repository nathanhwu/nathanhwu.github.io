    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an incoming graduate student at <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard's PhD Program in Neuroscience</a>. 
        I'm broadly interested in exploring how complex biological systems organize to robustly support diverse computations.
        I hope to uncover general computational principles that span timescales and systems (both neural and non-neural). Some methods and tools I'm interested in exploring include graph theory, dynamical systems, and recurrent neural networks.
        I'm grateful to be supported by a <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/education/graduate-fellowship/" target="_blank">Kempner Graduate Fellowship</a>.

        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Yale University in 2024, where I double-majored in Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry as well as Computer Science.
        While I was there, I studied neural computations in fruit fly motion detection with <a href="https://clarklab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Damon Clark</a>. 
        I also spent two summers as a visiting student researcher in <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/" target="_blank">Michael Levin's</a> lab at Tufts University where I studied the self-organization of neuronal cultures on a high-density microelectrode array system.

        I'm currently interning at <a href="https://www.mxwbio.com/" target="_blank">MaxWell Biosystems</a> in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland for the next few months before starting my PhD in the fall.

        Stay tuned for more updates! This website is still in development, and there's more to come :)
